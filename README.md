=================

A movies search app written via angularjs demonstrates angular html5 routing with crawlable snapshots created with html-snapshots (node)

### Capturing static html snapshots for SEO

Build all the content page urls in sitemap.xml to make the content crawlable, snapshots-renderer/capture.js is a node app that uses "html-snapshots" package sp run "npm install html-snapshots" to install the package and it also requires "phantomjs" that you can download it from http://phantomjs.org/

All files under snapshots directory are sample files. You shuold/can cleanup that folder before create your own snapshots.
